# v8worker-docker

Here you can find a Dockerfile sample that can be used to create Go applications that use the [v8worker](https://github.com/ry/v8worker) package. 

Copy this file and add your own Docker commands to complete it. Be aware that building all the layers will take quite some time (my lastest build finished in 1h 26min).
